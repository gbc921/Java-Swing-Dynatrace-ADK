# Java Swing Dynatrace App Mon (ADK) instrumentation
This is a very small test to see how the Java Swing ADK instrumentation works on a application.

The application just loads one image, and can do image subtraction or left/right rotation. A simple interface screenshot is seen below:

PS.: Webserver needs to be instrumented with webserver agent and AppMon needs to have UEM enabled to be able to make this ADK works.
